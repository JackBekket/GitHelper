# GitHelper

GitHelper is a tool designed to help users manage and interact with their Git repositories. It provides a command-line interface for various Git-related tasks, such as creating, cloning, and pushing repositories. Additionally, it offers integration with other tools and services, such as Reflexia, to enhance the user's workflow.

## Functionality

The GitHelper package consists of several components:

1. **Reflexia Integration:** The `internal/reflexia_integration/reflexia_integration.go` file handles the integration with Reflexia, allowing users to interact with their repositories through Reflexia's API.

2. **RAG Implementation:** The `pkg/rag/rag.go` file implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which is used to retrieve relevant information from a vector store and generate a response based on the user's query.

3. **Command-Line Interface:** The `main.go` file provides the command-line interface for interacting with Git repositories. Users can use this interface to perform various Git-related tasks, such as creating, cloning, and pushing repositories.

4. **Configuration:** The `project_config` directory contains configuration files for different programming languages and platforms, allowing users to customize the behavior of GitHelper.

5. **Testing:** The `main_test.go` and `pkg/rag/rag_test.go` files contain unit tests for the main functionality and the RAG implementation, respectively.

## Usage

To use GitHelper, users can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment variables required for the Reflexia integration.
3. Configure the tool using the configuration files in the `project_config` directory.
4. Run the `main.go` file to access the command-line interface.

## Edge Cases

- If the Reflexia API is unavailable, the integration will fail, and users will not be able to interact with their repositories through Reflexia.
- If the configuration files are not set up correctly, the tool may not function as expected.

## Unclear Places

- The purpose of the `.envExample` file is not clear. It is possible that it is a template for the `.env` file, but this is not explicitly stated.
- The relationship between the RAG implementation and the Reflexia integration is not clear. It is possible that the RAG implementation is used to enhance the search functionality of the Reflexia integration, but this is not explicitly stated.

## Dead Code

- The `docker-compose.yaml` file appears to be unused, as there is no mention of Docker or containerization in the rest of the code.
