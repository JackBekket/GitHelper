## reflexia_integration

This package is designed to integrate with Reflexia, a tool for analyzing and summarizing code repositories. It handles the process of setting up the environment, loading project configurations, and running the summarization and analysis services.

### Initialization

The `InitPackageRunner` function is responsible for initializing the package runner service. It first loads environment variables `GH_USERNAME` and `GH_TOKEN`, then calls `processWorkingDirectory` to determine the working directory. Next, it calls `GetProjectConfig` to retrieve the project configuration and sets the `projectConfig` variable accordingly. After that, it calls `BuildPackageFiles` to obtain the package files. Finally, it creates instances of `SummarizeService`, `EmbeddingsService`, and `PackageRunnerService` using the gathered information and returns the `PackageRunnerService` object.

### Environment Loading

The `loadEnv` function is used to load environment variables. It takes the key of the environment variable as input and returns its value. If the environment variable is not set, it logs a fatal error.

### Working Directory Processing

The `processWorkingDirectory` function handles the determination of the working directory. It takes the GitHub link, GitHub username, and GitHub token as input. If the GitHub link is provided, it parses the URL and creates a temporary directory to clone the repository. If command-line arguments are provided, it sets the working directory to the first argument. Finally, it returns the working directory.

### Project Configuration

The `GetProjectConfig` function is responsible for retrieving the project configuration. It takes the GitHub link, GitHub username, and GitHub token as input and returns the project configuration.

### Package File Building

The `BuildPackageFiles` function is responsible for building the package files. It takes the working directory as input and returns the package files.

### Summarization Service

The `SummarizeService` is responsible for summarizing the code repository. It takes the loaded environment variables and LlmOptions as input and returns the summary.

### Vector Store

The vector store is used to store the embeddings of the code repository. It takes the loaded environment variables as input and returns the vector store.

### Embeddings Service

The `EmbeddingsService` is responsible for creating embeddings of the code repository. It takes the vector store as input and returns the embeddings.

### Package Runner Service

The `PackageRunnerService` is responsible for running the package runner. It takes the package files, project configuration, SummarizeService, EmbeddingsService, ExactPackages, OverwriteReadme, and WithFileSummary as input and returns the package runner.

### Exact Packages

The `ExactPackages` flag determines whether to use exact package names or not.

### Overwrite Readme

The `OverwriteReadme` flag determines whether to overwrite the existing README file or not.

### With File Summary

The `WithFileSummary` flag determines whether to include file summaries in the output or not.

### Edge Cases

The application can be launched by running the `reflexia_integration` executable. It can also be launched by importing the `reflexia_integration` package in another Go program.

### Unclear Places

The code does not explicitly mention how the `ExactPackages`, `OverwriteReadme`, and `WithFileSummary` flags are used. It is unclear how these flags affect the behavior of the package runner service.

### Dead Code

There is no apparent dead code in the provided code.
