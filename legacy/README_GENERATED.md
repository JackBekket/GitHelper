## RAG

This package provides a set of functions for performing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using various question answering chains. It leverages embeddings to retrieve relevant documents from a vector store and then uses these documents to generate answers to questions.

### File structure
- rag.go
- rag_test.go

### Code summary
The package defines several functions for performing RAG:

- `RagReflexia`: This function takes a question, API URL, API token, number of results, and a vector store as input. It creates an embeddings client, retrieves documentation and code metadata based on the question, combines the metadata into a single input for the LLM, and uses the stuffed QA chain to generate an answer to the question.

- `RagWithOptions`: This function is similar to `RagReflexia`, but it also takes additional options for the vector store.

- `StuffedQA_Rag`: This function takes a question, API URL, API token, number of results, and a vector store as input. It creates an embeddings client, retrieves relevant documents from the vector store, and uses the stuffed QA chain to generate an answer to the question.

- `RefinedQA_RAG`: This function takes a question, API URL, API token, number of results, and a vector store as input. It creates an embeddings client, retrieves relevant documents from the vector store, and uses the refine documents chain for question answering to generate an answer to the question.

All these functions use the provided API URL and API token to create an embeddings client, which is then used to retrieve relevant documents from the vector store. The retrieved documents are then used to generate an answer to the question using the specified question answering chain.

### Edge cases
The application can be launched by importing the package and calling any of the functions mentioned above.

### Unclear places
The package does not explicitly mention how the embeddings client is created or how the vector store is initialized. It assumes that these components are already set up and configured.

### Dead code
There is no apparent dead code in the package.
