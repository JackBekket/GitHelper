# rag

Package: rag

Imports:
- context
- fmt
- github.com/JackBekket/hellper/lib/embeddings
- github.com/tmc/langchaingo/chains
- github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/openai
- github.com/tmc/langchaingo/vectorstores

External data, input sources:
- The code uses a vector store to store and retrieve documents and code snippets.
- It relies on an OpenAI API to access a large language model (LLM) for text embedding and question answering.

Code summary:
- RagReflexia: This function performs a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) query by first retrieving relevant documents and code snippets from the vector store based on the input question. Then, it uses the retrieved content to answer the question using a stuffed QA chain.
- RagWithOptions: This function is similar to RagReflexia but allows for additional options to be passed to the vector store during the retrieval process.
- StuffedQA_Rag: This function performs a RAG query using the stuffed QA chain, which combines all retrieved documents into a single prompt for the LLM.
- RefinedQA_RAG: This function performs a RAG query using the refine documents chain, which iterates over the retrieved documents one by one to update the answer.

In summary, the rag package provides functions for performing RAG queries using various chains and options. It leverages a vector store and an OpenAI API to retrieve relevant information and generate answers to questions.

Project package structure:
- rag.go
- rag_test.go
- pkg/rag/rag.go

Relations between code entities:
- The functions RagReflexia, RagWithOptions, StuffedQA_Rag, and RefinedQA_RAG all interact with the vector store and the OpenAI API to perform RAG queries.
- The StuffedQA_Rag and RefinedQA_RAG functions use different chains to process the retrieved documents and generate answers.

Unclear places:
- It is unclear how the vector store is initialized and populated with documents and code snippets.
- It is unclear how the OpenAI API is configured and accessed.
