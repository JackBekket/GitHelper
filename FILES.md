**Summary:**  
  
### Overview  
  
This package contains a test file (`main_test.go`) that appears to be part of a larger project. The code is focused on generating a response to a given prompt using various AI/ML models and libraries.  
  
### Functions  
  
#### `Test_main`  
  
This is a test function that sets up environment variables and then generates a response to a series of prompts. It uses the `godotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The function then iterates over a list of prompts and generates a response for each one.  
  
#### `getCollection`  
  
This function takes in four parameters (AI URL, API token, DB link, and namespace) and returns a `vectorstores.VectorStore` object. It uses the `embd` library to get the vector store.  
  
#### `generateResponse`  
  
This function takes in a prompt and a namespace, and returns a generated response. It uses the `getCollection` function to get the vector store, and then performs a semantic search using the `embeddings` library. The response is generated by combining the search results and a prompt.  
  
#### `rag`  
  
This function takes in a question, AI URL, API token, number of results, and a vector store, and returns a generated response. It creates an OpenAI client using the `openai` library, performs a semantic search using the `embeddings` library, and then generates a response using the `chains` library.
