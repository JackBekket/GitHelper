GitHelper is a tool that integrates with GitHub to provide AI-powered assistance for developers. It leverages a Reflexia integration to analyze code and generate responses, and it uses a database to store and manage the history of interactions.

The main function of the GitHelper package is to handle webhook events from GitHub and respond accordingly. It sets up a server that listens for incoming requests and processes them based on the event type.

When a new issue is opened, the GitHelper package retrieves the issue details, such as the repository name, issue ID, and issue title. It then uses the Reflexia integration to generate a response based on the issue content. The response is then posted as a comment on the issue.

For issue comments, the GitHelper package checks if the comment is from the bot itself and skips processing if it is. Otherwise, it retrieves the comment details and uses the Reflexia integration to generate a response. The response is then posted as a comment on the issue.

When a push event is received, the GitHelper package checks if the repository owner is whitelisted. If it is, it retrieves the repository URL and uses the Reflexia integration to run the package runner. This will analyze the code and update the database with the latest information.

The GitHelper package also includes functions for handling webhook events related to installation repositories and issues. These functions are responsible for updating the database with information about the repositories and issues, as well as generating responses to the events.

In addition to the main function, the GitHelper package includes several helper functions for tasks such as creating and updating database entries, retrieving information from GitHub, and interacting with the Reflexia integration.

Overall, the GitHelper package provides a comprehensive solution for integrating AI-powered assistance into GitHub workflows. It handles webhook events, interacts with the Reflexia integration, and manages a database to store and retrieve information about repositories and issues.
