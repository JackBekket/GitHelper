# GitHelper

This package is a test package for a larger project that generates responses to prompts using various AI/ML models and libraries.

## Configuration

* Environment variables:
	+ `AI_ENDPOINT`
	+ `API_TOKEN`
	+ `DB_URL`
* Files:
	+ None

## Launching the Application

The package can be launched using the following methods:

* Run `go test` to execute the test suite
* Run `go run main.go` to execute the main function (if present)

## Edge Cases

* The package is designed to be used as a test package, so it's not intended to be launched directly. However, if you want to run the main function, you can do so by running `go run main.go`.

## Relations between Code Entities

The code is structured in a way that it uses various libraries and functions to generate responses to prompts. The `main_test.go` file contains a test suite that sets up environment variables and generates responses to a series of prompts. The `getCollection` function is used to get a vector store, which is then used to generate a response. The `generateResponse` function uses the `getCollection` function to get the vector store and then performs a semantic search using the `embeddings` library. The `rag` function is not used in the test suite, but it seems to be a separate function that generates a response using the `openai` library.

## Unclear Places/Dead Code

There is a TODO comment in the `Test_main` function suggesting that the code should be refactored. However, there are no other unclear places or dead code found in the provided files.
